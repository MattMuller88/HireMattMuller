# First Quick Setup
This is my initial basic design of the website that will be changed and improved as I brainstorm on more creative designs and expand upon my HTML, CSS, and JavaScript skills.

It includes a header and paragraph on the home page, a nav bar with links to different pages, a button for my resume, and a logo in addition to some basic transitions and functionality for links and window resizing.
