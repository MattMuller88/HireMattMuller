# First Update
This is my first set of changes made to my initial setup of the website.


I decided to change to a one-page format where the nav links will automatically scroll to the corresponding section of the page (functionality yet to be implemented). I made some stylistic changes, including a new homepage background that I found to be a more creative and appealing introduction for myself than the previous image. I added a circular image of myself to the profile section which will soon have about me and details texts on either side of it. I also implemented alternating dark and light colored backgrounds for each section, the colors and designs of which may change in the future. Finally, I redisigned the navbar to be aligned vertically against the right side of the screen with a relative position that keeps it in that location as you scroll through the site.


For my next step, I plan to fill out each section with content, spending somewhat limited time on customization. Once the layout and substance of all of the pages is close to what I am looking for, I will spend more time fine-tuning things like colors, fonts, transitions, etc.
