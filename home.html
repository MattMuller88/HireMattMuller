                                Computer Science. Here I learned a wide range of new Software Development skills and
                                graduated with a Bachelor's of Science degree in Computer Science.</p>

                                Computer Programming. Throughout this course, I
                                developed a true passion for software development and realized that it was an excellent

                                schools, I decided to complete my general classes at TRCC in order to save money. Here I

                                on the AP Physics exam to go along with a 1400 SAT score. I was also awarded the

                                reccomendation and was only awarded to roughly 5-10/200 students in my graduating class.

                        use each
                        one effectively. Throughout the course I developed and tested code for a scheduling application.
                        I created classes for contacts, tasks, and appointments, as well as service classes for each and
                        then implemented white-box testing by writing JUnit tests to ensure that they were fully

                        the client and the server through the creation of JSON files. I also created a software design

                    <p class="proj-desc">Throughout this course I learned how to develop secure code through the
                        analysis of advanced security concepts, as well as how to apply encryption technologies and
                        techniques to communicate securely. I began by producing a vulnerability assessment report based
                        on the presented client. After this, I implemented an https protocol for their website and
                        incorporated a hashing algorithm for the data being sent between the server and the browser.
                        Finally, I produced a report documenting the improvements to the client's security</p>

                    <p class="proj-desc">In this course I gained a solid understanding of the design phase of the
                        SDLC. I began by reading transcripts from interviews with the
                        project's client in order to assess the project's requirements. I then utilized both process
                        and object modeling in order to design a system that would satisfy these requirements.
                        This included creating use case, activity, sequence, and class diagrams, as well as
                        assessing the technical requirements of the system. Finally, I created a presentation to explain to the client how the
                        system satisfied their requirements.</p>

                        for data management, manipulation, and analysis. I learned about relational databases and how to
                        use relational database management systems. I utilized MySQL to load in large
                        datasets from csv files and constructed queries to organize and analyze the data in order to
                        find trends and gain insight on business operations.</p>
